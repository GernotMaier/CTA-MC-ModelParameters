\section{Workflows for Model Parameter Validation}

\subsection{Cherenkov photon density}

Cherenkov photon densities vs distance to shower core for different primary energies

\subsection{Effective area calculator}

Calculate effective areas for a given set of model parameters. Comparison to a reference set of simulations.

\subsection{Atmospheric transmission comparison}

Compare transmission probabilities as function of wavelengths for different emission heights.
