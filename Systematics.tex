\section{Workflows for the Estimation of Systematic Uncertainties}

\subsection{Systematic uncertainties from aerosol transmission configurations}

Impact on IRFs using different aerosol transmission configuration.

Determination of correction factors on energy for Level A and Level B analysis.

\subsection{Systematic error calculator for standard IRFs metrics}

Calculates systematic differences of IRFs produced for the given MC model compared to reference IRFs as function of e.g., energy, elevation, etc.
