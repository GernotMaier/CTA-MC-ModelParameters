\section{Simulation types}

\subsection{Simulation of gamma-ray showers}

\subsection{Simulation of hadronic showers}

Required for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item comparison of rates
    \item Calibration CTA
    \item cosmic-ray electron monitoring
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulation of electron showers}

\subsection{Simulation of the illuminator}

Simulation of pulsed and continuous light emitted from an artifical light source positioned at distances of 500 to 1500 m ('illuminator').

\subsection{High-precision optical simulations}

High-precision simulations (mostly ray tracing) of the telescope structure and optics including even minor components (usually included in a global correction factor to improve the efficiency of the simulations)

\subsection{Simulation as function of observation quality parameters}

Simulation productions to allow for the estimation of the performance reduction for different aerosol and cloudiness conditions (impact on energy range, sensitivity, energy resolution, gamma-ray PSF, systematic uncertainty)
