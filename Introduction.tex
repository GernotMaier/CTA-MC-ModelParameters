\section{Introduction}

This document describes in details the MC model parameters, the corresponding workflows for setting and validating them, and the procedures to calculate the corresponding systematic uncertainties.

This document is part of a series describing the CTA MC Simulation Pipeline. 
It is expected that the reader is familiar with the wider concept of \simsys as described in  \cite{CTAConcept}.
